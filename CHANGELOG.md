  - ### ü§ï Fixes

    - **Fix command to work properly as a cargo command - [csmoe], [issue/39] [pull/44]**

      Previous to this commit, `cargo-generate` was a CLI tool that was invoked by the
      command `cargo-generate` (note the dash). However, this tool intends to be a cargo
      subcommand! This commit changes how you invoke the tool- no more dash!

      ```
      cargo generate --git https://github.com/username/project --name look-ma-no-dash
      ```

    - **Fix casing on `crate_name` substitution - [ashleygwilliams], [issue/41] [pull/56]**

      `crate_name` substitution is supposed to be a convenience, converting the given
      project's name to a name that you could use with `extern crate` or in other *in-code*
      situations. Just one problem- before this commit, it didn't change the case! 
      Now it will. Thanks so much to [fitzgen] for filing this issue (and a bunch of others)!

  - ### üìñ Documentation

    - **Document build and runtime dependencies - [migerh], [issue/42] [pull/45]**

      There are a few dependencies for the project that we hadn't documented. Many folks
      have these already installed, but some don't- so it's great that they are now well
      documented in the `README`.

  - ### üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance

    - **Test substitutions - [ashleygwilliams], [issue/34] [pull/56]**

      We had features we weren't testing. This PR now adds test coverage for:

        - substitution of `crate_name`
        - correct casing change of `crate_name`
        - substitution in files beyond `Cargo.toml`

      We still don't have full coverage but at least it's improving!

    - **Split test helpers into files - [ashleygwilliams], [issue/33] [pull/35]**

      "i like small files and i cannot lie"
